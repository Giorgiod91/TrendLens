# Honda Stock Price Predictor

This project is a small-scale experiment to predict future stock prices based on historical data from the **Honda Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to apply **Linear Regression**, a fundamental concept in machine learning, to build a predictive model. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a stepping stone towards gaining deeper practical knowledge in the field of machine learning.

## üöÄ Project Goals
- Use **Linear Regression** to predict stock prices (e.g., `Adj_Close`) based on historical data.
- Apply concepts learned from the **Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng**.
- Practice and enhance my knowledge of machine learning by applying theories in a practical scenario.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Honda Dataset**, which includes daily stock information such as:
- `Date`: The trading date.
- `Adj_Close`: Adjusted closing price.
- `Close`: Closing price.
- `High`, `Low`, `Open`: Stock price at various points in the trading day.
- `Volume`: The number of shares traded.

The data provides a rich source for exploring trends and predicting prices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing stock trends and results.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing linear regression and data preprocessing.

## üìà Implementation
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and transform the data as needed.
- Convert the `Date` column to a numerical format to include it as a feature if required.

### 2. Model Development
- Implement **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.
- Train the model on historical stock prices to predict the next day's price.

### 3. Learning Objectives
This project is designed to:
- Reinforce the foundational concepts of linear regression and machine learning.
- Provide hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Explore how well simple models perform on financial datasets.

## üí° Future Work
This project is an ongoing learning exercise, and future plans include:
1. Experimenting with more advanced models such as polynomial regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
2. Exploring other stock datasets to generalize the model.


## ü§î Why This Project?
I am interested learning machine learning and its applications. Inspired by Andrew Ng's course, I wanted to apply my knowledge to a real-world dataset. This project combines my interest in finance and machine learning, offering an exciting opportunity to learn through practice.

## üôå Acknowledgments
- **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course**: For introducing me to the fundamental concepts of ML.
- **Kaggle**: For providing the Honda stock dataset.
- The open-source Python community for tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
